I am a 3rd year PhD student with research focused on solving problems in field of clean energy. I develop novel machine learning methods for solving problems in energy capture and light emission. I am also working with quantum computers to accelerate existing quantum chemistry methods to search for efficient stable clean energy storage materials. 

Besides my research, I am also interested in education and public outreach activities. I have taught in several machine learning bootcamps, teaching to graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and industry representatives.
